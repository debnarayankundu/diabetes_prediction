## Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management are crucial for reducing complications. This project utilizes a machine learning approach to predict diabetes based on medical features such as glucose level, BMI, and insulin level.



## Features
The dataset includes the following features:
- `Pregnancies`: Number of times pregnant
- `Glucose`: Plasma glucose concentration
- `BloodPressure`: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- `SkinThickness`: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- `Insulin`: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- `BMI`: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`: Diabetes pedigree function
- `Age`: Age (years)
